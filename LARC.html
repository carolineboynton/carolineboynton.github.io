	<h1>Caroline's First Internship: Los Altos Research Center (LARC)</h1>

	<h2>What is LARC?</h2>
		<p>LARC is a Silicon Valley startup that is delivering a new internet platform, “the Matrix,” with the goal of providing complete consumer privacy and 
		security with a proprietary encryption technology to prevent identity theft, spoofing, and personal data tracking.  <p>
		<p>Caroline alpha and beta tested the platform and apps providing feedback to product management for consideration of new features and functionality. She also marketed the 
		service and new product offerings with a team of eight peers through social media and face-to-face customer engagement. Additionally, she generated sales by registering new paid users and 
		selling annual subscriptions to Matrix platform.
