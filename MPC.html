	<h1>Marketing Specialist at Mighty Peace Coffee</h1>

	<h2>A little about my job at Mighty Peace Coffee</h2>
		<p>Mighty Peace Coffee is a startup coffee company that sources their coffee from the Congo. I became involved with Mighty Peace Coffee through a committee I was on in Mu Kappa Tau, a marketing club on campus. <p>
		<p>I am working on a Program Team to develop a marketing strategy through analytics and social media campaigns. I have been A/B testing the marketing campaigns created by team members and utilizing Google Analytics to strategically 
		improve campaigns. I developed a social media challenge to improve the company's presence in the coffee industry and promote the company's mission.
