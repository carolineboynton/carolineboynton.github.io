	<h1>Caroline Boynton, Instructor at Dragonfly Hot Yoga</h1>

	<h2>My yoga journey</h2>
		<p>In the summer of 2019, I completed my 200-Hour Registered Yoga Teacher Training at Corepower Yoga.<p>
		<p>Last year, at Dragonfly Hot Yoga, I taught two 60-minute Power Vinyasa flow classes weekly to a total of about 40-50 studio clients. This year,
			I am teaching core flow on Friday's at 12:30. My classes empower my students to discover and strengthen their mind-body connection and find an improvement in their mental and physical health. 
			I design each yoga class with an intelligently sequenced flow set to uplifting music and assist with store merchandise sales.
